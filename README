# Centpkg
Centpkg is a wrapper for [rpkg](https://fedorahosted.org/rpkg/) which interacts
with RPM git repositories like the ones hosted at http://git.centos.org. Rpkg provides
some convenience methods/commands for local builds via mock or rpmbuild, for
interacting with koji, and for generating patches.

# Centpkg is in pre-alpha state, as of now this is a proof of concept.
For now only a very small subset of rpkg commands are enabled. 



## Installing
Centpkg currently requires the [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repository for pyrpkg and other dependencies. 

    root# <Install and configure EPEL-Release>
    root# yum install pyrpkg
    root# git clone https://bitbucket.org/bstinsonmhk/centpkg.git
    root# cd centpkg
    root# python setup.py install

## Currently Somewhat-working Commands
### Clone 
    
    $ centpkg clone --anonymous -b c7 a2ps        # clones the CentOS 7 branch of the a2ps package

### Sources

    $ cd a2ps                                     # Change to the directory we just cloned
    $ centpkg sources                             # Downloads the binary sources from lookaside and checks hashes

## Commands Currently in Development
### Firehose
*WARNING*: this will download _all_ repositories from git.centos.org

    # Downloads all source repos and switches to the CentOS 7 Branch. 
    # If --sources is specified get the sources too. 
    $ centpkg firehose --anonymous -b c7 [--sources]
